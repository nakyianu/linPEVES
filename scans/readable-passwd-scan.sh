# is readable to a user, this does not necessarily pose a danger 
# to the system. Typically, this file IS readable to many unprivileged users.
#
#   In this case, a vulnerability is found when a user's password
# is not hidden from view in /etc/passwd. In other words, a user's 
# password might be on display in this readable file.
